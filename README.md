# 2D Shearing Transformation – Windows Forms

This project demonstrates the **2D Shearing transformation** using a simple Windows Forms application written in **C#**.

## 📐 Concept
Shearing is a type of geometric transformation that shifts one coordinate proportionally to another.

The applied equations are:
```
x' = x + shX * y
y' = y + shY * x
```

## 🧩 Features
- Draws the original triangle
- Applies 2D Shearing transformation
- Displays the transformed triangle
- Uses GDI+ for rendering

## 🛠 Technologies
- C#
- Windows Forms
- GDI+

## ▶️ How to Run
1. Open the solution file (`.sln`) in Visual Studio
2. Build and run the project
3. The black triangle represents the original shape
4. The blue triangle represents the sheared shape

## 📚 Educational Purpose
This project is intended for learning and demonstrating basic **computer graphics transformations**.
